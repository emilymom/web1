<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" title="love">I love my childrens <strong>seoha Three: Don't be his friend
You know</a> you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em 
I got new rules, I count 'em

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
<p>I never learn, (I never learn)
But my love (my love), he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend</p></body>
